Welcome to the sewer crawler game.  It is similar to most dungeon crawlers
Your goal is to find the princess... oops I mean dinosaur.
There are currently 2 levels.  The knight (player) can fight the baddies
with his sword by pressing the space bar.  Level transition occurs
when the knight collides with the stairs.  The game is over when the knight
collides with a baddie or collides with the dinosaur in the lower level

How to execute:
"main" is located in game.py under sewer_crawler package.  
Required imports are documented in the requirements.txt

After running main, a start menu will pop up. Press start with the mouse
Controls are L, R, U, D arrow keys or standard WASD.
Space Bar is attack.  If player collides with the dino NPC, the game will end 
with a quest complete screen.  If player collides with a baddie, the game ends with a 
game over screen.  Player can press play again button with mouse to start again.

Good luck!

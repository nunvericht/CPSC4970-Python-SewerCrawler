Welcome to the sewer crawler game.  It is similar to most dungeon crawlers
Your goal is to find the princess... oops I mean dinosaur.
There are currently 2 levels.  The knight (player) can fight the baddies
with his sword by pressing the space bar.  Level transition occurs
when the knight collides with the stairs.  The game is over when the knight
collides with a baddie or collides with the dinosaur in the lower level

How to execute:
main is run from game.py and found under sewer_crawler/main_game/
required imports are documented in the requirements.txt

After running main, a start menu will pop up. Press start with the mouse
Controls are L, R, U, D arrow keys or standard WASD
Space Bar is attack.  After locating the dinosaur, if player collides with 
npc, the game will end

Good luck!
